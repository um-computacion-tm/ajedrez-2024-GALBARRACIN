## Content


The content is based on two projects with fully functional codes belonging to a chess made in console, with its tests and its corresponding structure. And the other project is made graphically using pygame to be more user friendly (located in another branch).


### Console Chess Project - Python
## How it works


This project is an implementation of the console chess game using Python. The main goal is to create a functional and accessible game, which allows two players to face each other in an interactive way.


## Features
- Fully functional game with all standard chess rules.
- Console interface for entering commands and moving pieces.
- Automatic verification of rules such as check, checkmate and draw.
- Automatic turn switching between players.
- Updatable score at the end of each game.
- Support for unit tests, executable with the test command to ensure code stability and quality.
- Modular structure that facilitates maintenance and the addition of new features.


## Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Unit test system with unittest
- Code coverage support to ensure development with high quality standards.


### PYGAME Chess


- Includes a chess designed in pygame, it is more aesthetic and intuitive for the user. (it is in another branch due to an error in Visual Studio Local when trying to restructure it)
